# chunk files prometheus

In Prometheus, chunk files are a fundamental component of the storage engine used to efficiently organize and manage time series data. Here's an explanation of chunk files in Prometheus:

1. **Chunk-based Storage**: Prometheus organizes time series data into chunk files to optimize storage efficiency and query performance. Instead of storing individual samples separately, Prometheus groups samples into contiguous blocks called chunks.

2. **Chunk Encoding**: Each chunk file contains encoded data for multiple time series samples. Prometheus uses a specialized encoding scheme, such as the Gorilla compression algorithm, to encode and compress samples within chunks. This encoding reduces storage overhead and improves disk utilization.

3. **Chunk Structure**: Chunk files typically consist of multiple chunks, each representing a time series or a subset of samples for a particular metric. Chunks store samples in a compressed format, along with metadata such as the series ID, timestamps, and other necessary information for efficient retrieval.

4. **Time Series Segmentation**: Prometheus segments time series data based on time intervals, typically using a configurable time window. Within each time interval, samples are grouped into chunks based on similarity and compression efficiency. This segmentation enables efficient data access and retrieval during query execution.

5. **Append-only**: Chunk files in Prometheus are append-only, meaning that new samples are continuously appended to the end of the file as they arrive. This append-only nature simplifies data management and ensures data consistency and durability, as existing samples are never modified or overwritten.

6. **Compaction**: Periodically, Prometheus performs compaction to merge and consolidate smaller chunks into larger ones. Compaction helps optimize storage utilization, reduce disk space fragmentation, and improve query performance by minimizing the number of chunks accessed during query execution.

7. **Retention and Deletion**: Chunk files play a crucial role in retention policies and data deletion in Prometheus. When data expires based on the configured retention period, Prometheus deletes entire chunk files associated with expired data, ensuring efficient space management and timely removal of obsolete data.

Overall, chunk files in Prometheus provide an efficient and scalable storage mechanism for managing time series data, enabling fast and reliable querying of metric data in a monitoring environment.
